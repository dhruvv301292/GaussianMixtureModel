# GaussianMixtureModel
A numPy based Gaussian Mixture Model for clustering data

Data is taken from 3 different Normal Distributions with different means and standard deviations. 

Gaussian Mixture Model is implemented using numPy and it's results corroborated using sklearn's mixture module.

Dataset: In the file gmm data.txt, each row is a unique vector of 5 dimensions. There are 3000 unique
examples. Hence N = 3000, d = 5, and we want to group these points into three clusters (K = 3).
